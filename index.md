Welcome to my blog. It's a work in progress, as it will always be. You can learn more about me [here](/about.md) and my first [post](/_posts/2024-06-02-welcome.md) explains what this blog is for. If you are interested in talking to me about mine or your ideas, please [contact](mailto:andrewtylerlandau at gmail.com) me! It's my favorite part about being a scientist.
