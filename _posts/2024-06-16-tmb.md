Wow, we did it. Along with my partner Jasmine, we <span class="post-caption">fastpacked<span class="post-caption-text">Read: run-walk with small backpacks full of food, water, and dry clothes, sleeping in mountain huts called refugios each night.</span></span> the [Tour du Mont Blanc](https://www.autourdumontblanc.com/en/), a roughly 100 mile trail that circles the Mont Blanc massif in France, Italy, and Switzerland. On our feet, from start to finish. Okay, sometimes our butts. I can't believe it's over, but at the same time I fully knew we could do it. Still, it's wild to know that my first time doing such a gargantuan running adventure is behind me. 

### Why would we do something like this? 
Many people (including me, for what it's worth) like weekends filled with food, relaxation, a respite from work, and socializing with friends. This was a little different. This involved many massive climbs with over a kilometer of ascent, technical descents on steep trails filled with roots and rocks, tricky snow passes at over 2400m above sea level, and a progressive increase of the deepest fatigue in my legs I've ever experienced. Sounds hard, right? And yet, I loved every <span class="post-caption">second<span class="post-caption-text">Even the low points... more on that soon.</span></span> of it. 

There are several reasons why I wanted to fastpack TMB, as there must be for something as challenging as this.

#### The challenge
I love pushing myself and seeing what I can do. It's something I take with me in all aspects of my life, and running is one of the best places to carry this kind of attitude because it's extremely measurable. I had never run over 100 miles in 4 days. Now I have. 

Experiencing the grit that is summonable in the human body is a fantastic feeling, but not one that is easy to come by. In my typical week, I'll run 45-50 miles, with some workouts and a long run. It can be tiring, but not like this. Only when it's 2, 3, and 4 days deep into 100 miles, and there's still a vertical kilometer or two to climb with 10s of miles left in the day, is it possible to discover what the body is capable of. Finding a way to run strong on those later days was exhilarating and has left me feeling even more powerful in my body than I ever have before.

#### The experience
I love going on running adventures like this. So far, Jasmine and I have done a 2-day trip on the south coast of England and a 3-day trip on the coast of France near Nice and Menton. Every single time, we learn more about how to plan, manage, and endure the challenge of running long distances on back-to-back days far from home. Of course, stepping up the distance and number of days makes it harder, and for that I feel all the more ready for more adventures like this in the future. 

#### The history
The Tour du Mont Blanc is a mecca for hikers and trail runners. That's partly because of the beauty of the landscape and geography, the wow-factor of running around such a huge mountain, and of course the fun of experiencing three countries and all the food along the way. But for us, it was especially meaningful because the biggest ultra marathon in the world each year is held here each year, called the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc - or [UTMB](https://montblanc.utmb.world/races/UTMB). 

Every year, the greatest trail runners in the world, along with many other less famous but equally impressive runners, congregate in Chamonix, France, to run all 100 miles of the TMB in a single effort. Courtney Dauwalter, Kilian Jornet, Francois D'Haene, Jim Walmsley, Zach Miller, Mathieu Blanchard, Katie Schide, I could go on, .. have all made their pilmigrages to this place, sometimes year after year, in the hope of winning and claiming their place in trail running fame. I love watching the competition, of course, but more than that it was amazing to run in this place knowing that I was running in the footsteps of all these inspirational runners who had the same goal as me: make it back to Chamonix in one piece (hopefully as fast as possible).

### The adventure
The reasons I listed above are important, but they're kind of the supporting reasons. It's important to have supporting reasons. But running in a place I've seen on TV isn't really enough of a drive for digging in on day 4. Getting experience for future experiences like this is circular reasoning and doesn't help if there isn't an underlying motivation. And as every Type A person knows, pushing yourseful for the sake of it only works until it doesn't. There's always a crash or burn out, and let me tell you, without a deeper reason for doing this I can easily imagine quitting on this one. 

That brings me to the heart of it all: the yearning for adventure. The main reason I run is for the adventure. I run so I can get out there and see the world, pushing myself beyond <span class="post-caption">boundaries<span class="post-caption-text">Boundaries both physical and psychological!</span></span> and experiencing as much of this beautiful earth as I can. Training and getting faster is fun and satisfying, of course, but the main reason underlying it all is so I am prepared for experiences like fastpacking the TMB. And the TMB did not disappoint. 

#### The mountain
I live in London, England. It's a pretty place, with a bucolic countryside, an impressive <span class="post-caption">coastline<span class="post-caption-text">Seven sisters, the cliffs of Dover, Pembrokeshire Coastal Path...</span></span>, and its share of parks with stunning <span class="post-caption">mountains<span class="post-caption-text">So far I've been to the Lake District, Snowdonia, The Peak District, and Brecon Beacon</span></span>. But it's hard to beat the beauty of the Alps, and the Mont Blanc massif is the queen of the alps at that. You can clearly make out the entire massif from terrain maps of the <span class="post-caption">region<span class="post-caption-text">see first image above</span></span>, from a <span class="post-caption">plane<img class="post-caption-image" src="{{ 'assets/images/240616-tmb/monty-b.jpeg' | relative_url }}" alt="Mont-Blanc from a plane."></span>, and of course throughout the whole 100 mile extent of the tour. As we ran around the massif, we got to see the entire range from every angle, standing high above us even as we reached the high points of the tour. It's unreal to see towering "<span class="post-caption">Aiguilles<span class="post-caption-text">what they call many peaks here, translates to "needle" in French</span></span>", massive glaciers, and an otherwise unworldly landscape I rarely get to experience. 

There's also something supremely satisfying about completely encircling such a huge geological feature. The massif is big and tall enough to see from many places - I've seen it from the train around Lake Geneva, while skiing in Verbier, on a high-alpine hike far away in Italy, and of course from a plane. So to stand in Chamonix witnessing it close up, then run around the whole mountain, and return to the same place 4 days later knowing that we carried ourselves on our own 2 feet around the entire thing brings an indescribable feeling of pride and gratitude. 

I'm so grateful that such beautiful places exist and that we get to experience them intimately on adventures like this.

#### The trail
Looking out at the mountain is amazing. But just being on such a wild and varied trail was amazing too. 


#### The food
