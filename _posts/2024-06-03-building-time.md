subheader: Thoughts on building my first static website
---

## We have a site!!

Alright, that was fun. I've been wanting to build a static website for a while and finally did it. It was fun! Since the point of this website is to capture my thoughts and learnings, I'll start by sharing what I learned about making a site (read: learning a new programming language) in the age of AI. 

### To depend or not to depend on a chat bot
I started out with a jekyll template site as is customary for Github pages. I wanted to start customizing right away, so I started asking Claude and ChatGPT for some help. Unfortunately, I found myself stuttering without progress. Don't get me wrong, they're certainly useful, and I use them to help with python code somewhat often, but I didn't feel like they helped me with learning how to build a site. I would tell them something that I want, they'd would print some code, I'd copy and paste, and then something would change in the site, but not exactly what I wanted and I didn't fully understand. 

I figured I needed to properly understand the basics, so I restarted my website and went through Jekyll's [step-by-step tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) to get a handle for the basics.

There's really nothing that beats learning from a manual or a basic tutorial.

You know, it sometimes feels like hacking is faster. "Hmm, I just want to make the nav bar a bit prettier, let me ask ChatGPT", but unless hacks are built off of a basis of knowledge, I think they just slow me down. I've got an engineering kind of mind, so can't help but tinkering and optimizing, and you can't do that unless you _understand what you're doing._ 

### To not to depend first, and then...
The funny thing is, after using the basic tutorial and looking up a few more how-tos online, then the chatbots became super useful. I think the reason is because once I had a little nugget of knowledge, then I could understand what the chatbots were showing mean and then learn the structure from that. 

I guess it's a bit like bootstrapping-- you can't start a computer with the most complex program, you have to initialize it with something simpler first then work from there. Since I've never worked with HTML or CSS before, getting thrown a bunch of code from a chatbot was overwhelming and had too much information for me to digest. But after 30 minutes of careful, dedicated learning, they sped up my work loads. 

Speaking of computers, back before we had electronic computers, we had people who were responsible for solving tedious calculations and they were called... "computers"... (Side note: I learned about this because [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/computer-conducts-data-analysis/) hired many women 'computers' and this was featured in the excellent movie [Hidden Figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures)). In this sense, I think a chatbot does exactly what the original intention for the concept of a computer is expected to. Chatbots speed up tedious calculations that we know how to do but would rather not so we can focus on higher level problems. And there's the key: 

<div class="text-highlight">
The value of chatbots is maximized when we use them for things we already know how to do.
</div>

Case in point: I am a skilled python programmer and use chatbots somewhat often, but I almost always didn't need them, I just wanted to go faster. 

### The practicals
Okay, that's my random, probably completely unoriginal rant about how chatbots aren't useful until you know how to do what you're asking them to do. But what about the actual site design?
