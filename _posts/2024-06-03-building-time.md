subheader: Thoughts on building my first static website
---

## We have a site!!

Alright, that was fun. I've been wanting to build a static website for a while and finally did it. It was fun! Since the point of this website is to capture my thoughts and learnings, I'll start by sharing what I learned about making a site (read: learning a new programming language) in the age of AI. 

### To depend or not to depend on a chat bot
I started out with a jekyll template site as is customary for Github pages. I wanted to start customizing right away, so I started asking Claude and ChatGPT for some help. Unfortunately, I found myself stuttering without progress. Don't get me wrong, they're certainly useful, and I use them to help with python code somewhat often, but I didn't feel like they helped me with learning how to build a site. I would tell them something that I want, they'd would print some code, I'd copy and paste, and then something would change in the site, but not exactly what I wanted and I didn't fully understand. 

I figured I needed to properly understand the basics, so I restarted my website and went through Jekyll's [step-by-step tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) to get a handle for the basics.

There's really nothing that beats learning from a manual or a basic tutorial.

You know, it sometimes feels like hacking is faster. "Hmm, I just want to make the nav bar a bit prettier, let me ask ChatGPT", but unless hacks are built off of a basis of knowledge, I think they just slow me down. I've got an engineering kind of mind, so can't help but tinkering and optimizing, and you can't do that unless you _understand what you're doing._
